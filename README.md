Imports:

TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob.
pandas and matplotlib.pyplot: For data manipulation and plotting (though plotting is not currently used in this example).
SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from nltk: For VADER sentiment analysis.
nltk: To download the VADER lexicon needed for sentiment analysis.
Function Definition:

analyze_tweet_sentiment(tweet_text): This function takes a string tweet_text as input and analyzes its sentiment.
Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob:

TextBlob(tweet_text): Creates a TextBlob object for the input tweet.
blob.sentiment.polarity: Computes the polarity score, which ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).
Sentiment Analysis with VADER:

SentimentIntensityAnalyzer(): Creates a VADER sentiment analyzer object.
sia.polarity_scores(tweet_text): Computes a sentiment score with positive, negative, neutral, and compound metrics.
Classify Sentiment:

Uses TextBlob's polarity score to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The classification is based on predefined thresholds:
Positive if the score is greater than 0.05.
Negative if the score is less than -0.05.
Neutral otherwise.
Print Results:

Prints the sentiment classification, TextBlob polarity score, VADER sentiment scores, subjectivity, and word count of the tweet.
Optional Plotting:

There's a placeholder for plotting sentiment distribution if analyzing multiple tweets. This part is commented out but can be used for visualization.
User Input and Function Call:

input("Enter a tweet: "): Prompts the user to enter a tweet.
analyze_tweet_sentiment(tweet_text): Calls the function with the entered tweet text to perform the sentiment analysis.
